Rayleigh distribution, Random Process and Quantization in Communication Systems
 In this project, we have three parts. 

1.Rayleigh Distribution:In the first part, we will review the Rayleigh distribution.


2.Random Processes: In the second part, we will analyze a random process to see if it is a Stationary Stochastic Process (WSS). If it's not, we will explore ways to make it a WSS process.


3.Quantization: In the third part, we will focus on pulse modulation and work on building a digital transmitter and receiver that can handle noise and decoding.
